- **Guest Upload** - Optional guest upload with file size and daily upload limits
- **Multiple Views** - Grid, list, and waterfall management views
- **Storage Classification** - Clearly distinguishes files from different storage backends
- **Dual Deployment Modes** - Keep Cloudflare Pages deployment, and add Docker self-host deployment (`docker compose up -d`)
- **Dynamic Storage Config Management** - Add/Edit/Delete/Test storage configs and switch default storage via admin API
- **Pluggable Settings Store (Docker)** - Basic app settings can use `sqlite` (default) or Redis protocol backends (Upstash / Redis / KVrocks)
- **Simplified Frontend** - Root pages remain the primary UX for upload/admin deployment.
- **GitHub Actions Docker Build** - Auto-build/push the single `ghcr.io/katelya77/k-vault` image on main/tag push

### 2026-03 Product Update

- Admin and folder console are now on root page (`/admin.html`) with:
  - folder tree + breadcrumbs
  - file/folder operations (create, rename, move, delete, batch actions)
  - drag upload queue (progress, retry, cancel)
  - direct link + signed share link copy
- Storage capability cards now keep all adapters visible (configured or not) with explicit status/hints.
- Existing direct links (`/file/:id`) remain compatible.

### Cloudflare Pages (No Build Step)

A lightweight workflow note is included in `.github/workflows/pages-deploy.yml`.

- No Cloudflare API secrets are required in this repository by default.
- Recommended deployment path is Cloudflare Pages Git integration (connect your fork directly in Cloudflare Dashboard).
- Leave Build command and Build output directory empty. YoruVault serves the root static pages plus `functions/`; `frontend/dist` is not part of the current Pages deployment.
- If you want CLI deployment, run Wrangler locally with your own credentials.

Recommended architecture for multi-cloud mounts:

- Use `WebDAV` adapter in YoruVault as a mounted entry.
- Use `alist/openlist` as aggregation layer for other providers.
- This keeps YoruVault focused on UX/link/auth while reducing adapter maintenance complexity.

---

## Deployment

YoruVault has two official deployment modes:

1. **Cloudflare Pages**: static root pages plus Pages Functions. This is best for Cloudflare KV/R2, edge functions, and free-tier deployments.
2. **Docker**: one image, `ghcr.io/katelya77/k-vault:latest`, for VPS/NAS/private self-hosting and long-running multi-storage deployments.

Both modes expose the same main entrypoints:

- Upload UI: `/`
- Admin console: `/admin.html`
- WebDAV page: `/webdav.html`
- Admin/API routes: `/api/*`
- Browser upload: `POST /upload`
- API Token upload: `/api/v1/upload`
- Direct/share links: `/file/*`, `/share/*`, `/s/*`

The Docker image runs Nginx and the Node API inside one container. From the user's perspective, the UI, admin console, WebDAV page, API Token upload, direct links, short links, and storage profile management should match the Cloudflare Pages deployment.

### Option 1: Cloudflare Pages

Use this when you want Cloudflare-hosted static pages, Pages Functions, KV, and R2.

1. **Fork this repository**

2. **Create a Pages project**
   - Log in to [Cloudflare Dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com)
   - Go to `Workers and Pages` -> `Create Application` -> `Pages` -> `Connect to Git`
   - Select the forked repository
   - Use these build settings:

| Item | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| Framework preset | `None` |
| Root directory | Empty (repository root) |
| Install command | Empty |
| Build command | Empty |
| Build output directory | Empty |
| Deploy command | Empty |

3. **Bind KV**
   - Open Cloudflare Dashboard -> `Workers and Pages` -> `KV`
   - Create a namespace, for example `k-vault`
   - Open the Pages project -> `Settings` -> `Functions` -> `KV namespace bindings`
   - The binding variable name must be `img_url`

4. **Configure at least one storage backend**
   - Go to project `Settings` -> `Environment variables`
   - Telegram example:

| Variable | Description | Required |
| :--- | :--- | :---: |
| `TG_Bot_Token` | Telegram Bot Token | Yes |
| `TG_Chat_ID` | Telegram channel ID | Yes |
| `BASIC_USER` | Admin username | Optional |
| `BASIC_PASS` | Admin password | Optional |

You can also use R2, S3-compatible storage, Discord, HuggingFace, WebDAV, or GitHub. See the Storage Configuration section below for backend-specific variables.

5. **Redeploy**
   - Environment variable or binding changes require a new deployment.
   - Visit `/api/status` and confirm the expected storage and KV/R2 status.

Common Pages mistakes:

- Do not set Deploy command to `npx wrangler deploy`; that is a Workers command, not a Pages command.
- Do not set Build command to `npm run build`.
- Do not set Build output directory to `dist` or `frontend/dist`.
- If R2 binding deployment fails with `invalid jurisdiction`, follow [Cloudflare Pages R2 binding troubleshooting](docs/cloudflare-pages-r2.md).

### Option 2: Docker

Use this for VPS, NAS, private network, or self-hosted multi-storage deployments. Docker does not depend on the Cloudflare Pages runtime.

#### Simplest Docker Run

No repository checkout and no local Node/npm installation are required:

```bash
docker volume create kvault_data
docker run -d \
  --name yoruvault \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  -v kvault_data:/app/data \
  ghcr.io/katelya77/k-vault:latest
```

Open:

- Upload UI: `http://<host>:8080/`
- Admin: `http://<host>:8080/admin.html`
- WebDAV page: `http://<host>:8080/webdav.html`
- Health check: `http://<host>:8080/api/health`

On first start, if `CONFIG_ENCRYPTION_KEY` and `SESSION_SECRET` are not provided, the container generates persistent values in `/app/data/runtime.env`. Recreating the container keeps them as long as the Docker volume is kept.

For public deployments, set admin credentials explicitly:

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name yoruvault \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  -v kvault_data:/app/data \
  -e BASIC_USER=admin \
  -e BASIC_PASS='replace-with-a-strong-password' \
  ghcr.io/katelya77/k-vault:latest
```

#### Recommended Docker Compose

If you cloned the repository:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

The Compose file pulls `ghcr.io/katelya77/k-vault:latest` by default. `.env` is optional. Create it only when you want fixed credentials, domain, upload limits, or environment-bootstrapped storage:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
docker compose up -d
```

Common Docker variables:

| Variable | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `BASIC_USER` / `BASIC_PASS` | Admin login credentials, recommended for public deployments |
| `PUBLIC_BASE_URL` | Public URL used for generated links and webhooks |
| `DEFAULT_STORAGE_TYPE` | Default storage: `telegram` / `r2` / `s3` / `discord` / `huggingface` / `webdav` / `github` |
| `TG_BOT_TOKEN` + `TG_CHAT_ID` | Telegram bootstrap storage variables for Docker |
| `R2_*` / `S3_*` / `WEBDAV_*` / `GITHUB_*` / `HF_*` | Other storage backend configuration |
| `UPLOAD_MAX_SIZE` / `CHUNK_SIZE` | Upload limits and chunk size |
| `WEB_PORT` | Public Compose port, default `8080` |

You can also start Docker first and add/test/switch storage profiles later in the admin console. The WebDAV page, API Tokens, API v1 uploads, direct links, and short links all use the same `8080` entrypoint.

For full Docker guide, see [README-DOCKER.md](README-DOCKER.md).

### WebDAV Regression Validation (Works for Pages and Docker)

After deployment, run at least one WebDAV smoke check to verify the full flow: config test -> upload -> download -> delete.

Example:

```bash
BASE_URL=https://your-domain \
BASIC_USER=admin BASIC_PASS=your_password \
SMOKE_STORAGE_TYPE=webdav \
SMOKE_STORAGE_CONFIG_JSON='{"baseUrl":"https://dav.example.com","username":"u","password":"p","rootPath":"uploads"}' \
node scripts/storage-regression.js
```

Validation criteria:

- `webdav.connected` in `/api/status` must be `true`
- Docker/self-hosted deployments can additionally verify `/api/storage/:id/test` returns `connected=true`
- WebDAV `upload / download / delete` in the regression script must all pass

For Docker deployment, simply change `BASE_URL` to your self-hosted address, for example `http://localhost:8080`.

## Storage Configuration

### Telegram Enhanced Mode (Self-hosted Bot API + Webhook)

This project supports switching the Telegram API base URL to a self-hosted Bot API and replying with direct links automatically via Webhook when files are received in groups/channels.

**Key environment variables:**

| Variable | Description | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `CUSTOM_BOT_API_URL` | Self-hosted Bot API URL (defaults to `https://api.telegram.org` if not set) | `http://127.0.0.1:8081` |
| `PUBLIC_BASE_URL` | Public domain used for Webhook backlink replies (recommended) | `https://img.example.com` |
| `TG_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | Webhook secret, verified by header `X-Telegram-Bot-Api-Secret-Token` | `your-secret` |
| `TELEGRAM_LINK_MODE` | Telegram link mode; set `signed` to enable signed direct links | `signed` |
| `MINIMIZE_KV_WRITES` | Set `true` to enable low-KV-write mode (also enables signed direct links) | `true` |
| `TELEGRAM_METADATA_MODE` | Telegram metadata write mode: `off` disables admin index writes; lightweight index is default | `off` |
| `TG_UPLOAD_NOTIFY` | Whether to send extra "direct link + File ID" notification after web upload succeeds | `true` |
| `FILE_URL_SECRET` | Signed direct-link secret (falls back to `TG_Bot_Token` if unset) | `random-long-secret` |

**Webhook deployment steps:**

1. Add the bot to the target channel/group on Telegram and grant permission to post (admin recommended for channels).
2. Set `TG_Bot_Token`, `PUBLIC_BASE_URL`, and `TG_WEBHOOK_SECRET` in Cloudflare Pages, then redeploy.
3. Call `setWebhook` and point to this project endpoint: `https://your-domain/api/telegram/webhook`.
4. Send images/files in the channel/group, and the bot will auto-reply with `/file/...` direct links.

**`setWebhook` example (official API):**

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.telegram.org/bot<YOUR_BOT_TOKEN>/setWebhook" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{\"url\":\"https://img.example.com/api/telegram/webhook\",\"secret_token\":\"<YOUR_SECRET>\",\"allowed_updates\":[\"message\",\"channel_post\"]}"
```

**`setWebhook` example (self-hosted Bot API):**

```bash
curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:8081/bot<YOUR_BOT_TOKEN>/setWebhook" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{\"url\":\"https://img.example.com/api/telegram/webhook\",\"secret_token\":\"<YOUR_SECRET>\",\"allowed_updates\":[\"message\",\"channel_post\"]}"
```

> **About 2GB files:**  
> With a self-hosted Bot API (`CUSTOM_BOT_API_URL`), when files are sent directly from a Telegram client to a group/channel and returned via Webhook links, you can use the Bot API large-file capability (commonly up to 2GB).  
> But the web upload path is still constrained by current frontend strategy and Cloudflare request size limits (see "Usage Limits" below), so it is not equivalent to direct 2GB upload from the web UI.
>
> **Note:** Downloading files through a self-hosted Bot API first caches files on local disk. Reserve enough space and monitor I/O.

### Telegram Low-KV-Write Mode (Optional)

If you are concerned about Cloudflare KV daily quota usage, you can enable:

- `TELEGRAM_LINK_MODE=signed` (signed direct links for Telegram files only)
- Or `MINIMIZE_KV_WRITES=true` (also affects chunked upload task write strategy)

After enabling this, Telegram files still write a lightweight KV index by default (for admin list and management operations). Downloads resolve `file_id` through signed parameters, reducing KV read/write pressure. With `TELEGRAM_METADATA_MODE=off`, signed Telegram uploads skip the post-upload KV metadata lookup: `password`, `expires_in`, `max_downloads`, and `slug` are ignored, and the response has no delete link. With `MINIMIZE_KV_WRITES=true`, API Token validation still reads KV, but writes `lastUsedAt` only on first use and then at least one hour apart.

> **Optional tradeoff:** If you want Telegram files to skip KV writes entirely, also set `TELEGRAM_METADATA_MODE=off`. In this mode, files will not appear in the admin list, and tag/allowlist/denylist/delete flows that rely on KV metadata will be unavailable.

### KV Storage (Required for Image Management)

To enable image management, configure KV:

1. Go to Cloudflare Dashboard -> `Workers and Pages` -> `KV`
2. Click `Create namespace`, name it `k-vault`
3. Go to your Pages project -> `Settings` -> `Functions` -> `KV namespace bindings`
4. Add binding: variable name `img_url`, choose the namespace you created
5. Redeploy the project

### R2 Storage (Large File Support, Optional)

Configure R2 to support uploads up to 100MB:

1. **Create a bucket**
   - Cloudflare Dashboard -> `R2 Object Storage` -> `Create bucket`
   - Name it `k-vault-files`

2. **Bind to the project**
   - Pages project -> `Settings` -> `Functions` -> `R2 bucket bindings`
   - Variable name `R2_BUCKET`, choose your bucket

3. **Enable R2**
   - `Settings` -> `Environment variables` -> add `USE_R2` = `true`
   - Redeploy

> If redeploy fails with `binding R2_BUCKET of type r2_bucket contains an invalid jurisdiction`, Cloudflare Pages is rejecting the R2 binding metadata before YoruVault code runs. Normal R2 buckets should not set `jurisdiction`; only residency-restricted buckets use `eu` or `fedramp`. Follow [Cloudflare Pages R2 binding troubleshooting](docs/cloudflare-pages-r2.md) to rebuild Production/Preview bindings, or run `npm run pages:r2:doctor -- --check` to validate `wrangler.jsonc`.

### S3-Compatible Storage (Optional)

Supports any S3-compatible object storage service, including AWS S3, MinIO, BackBlaze B2, Alibaba Cloud OSS, etc.

**Environment variables:**

| Variable | Description | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `S3_ENDPOINT` | S3 service endpoint URL | `https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com` |
| `S3_REGION` | Region | `us-east-1` |
| `S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID` | Access Key ID | `AKIA...` |
| `S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` | Secret Access Key | `wJalr...` |
| `S3_BUCKET` | Bucket name | `my-filebed` |

**Endpoint examples by provider:**

| Provider | Endpoint format | Region |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| AWS S3 | `https://s3.{region}.amazonaws.com` | `us-east-1` etc. |
| MinIO | `https://minio.example.com:9000` | `us-east-1` |
| BackBlaze B2 | `https://s3.{region}.backblazeb2.com` | `us-west-004` etc. |
| Alibaba Cloud OSS | `https://oss-{region}.aliyuncs.com` | `cn-hangzhou` etc. |
| Cloudflare R2 | `https://{account_id}.r2.cloudflarestorage.com` | `auto` |

**Deployment steps:**

1. Create a bucket in your S3 provider
2. Get Access Key ID and Secret Access Key
3. Add the environment variables above in your Cloudflare Pages project
4. Redeploy, and the frontend will automatically show S3 storage options

### Discord Storage (Optional)

Store files through a Discord channel, supporting both Webhook and Bot modes.

> **Note:** Discord attachment URLs expire after about 24 hours. This project provides downloads through a proxy and refreshes URLs automatically per request. The current version prioritizes Bot message lookup and falls back to Webhook lookup on failure. If both Bot and Webhook are configured, ensure the Bot has read access to the Webhook channel.

**Environment variables:**

| Variable | Description | Required |
| :--- | :--- | :---: |
| `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL` | Discord Webhook URL (recommended for uploads) | One of two |
| `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` | Discord Bot Token (for fetching and deleting files) | Recommended |
| `DISCORD_CHANNEL_ID` | Discord channel ID (required for Bot-mode upload) | Bot mode |

**Webhook deployment (recommended):**

1. In your Discord server, go to channel settings -> Integrations -> Webhooks
2. Create a new Webhook and copy the Webhook URL
3. Add environment variable `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL` in Cloudflare Pages
4. (Recommended) Also create a Discord Bot and set `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` for file retrieval and deletion
5. Redeploy

**Bot deployment:**

1. Go to [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and create an application
2. Create a Bot in the Bot tab and get the token
3. In OAuth2 -> URL Generator, select `bot` scope and grant `Administrator` permission to the Bot
4. Use the generated URL to invite the Bot to your server
5. Add `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` and `DISCORD_CHANNEL_ID` in Cloudflare Pages
6. Redeploy

**Troubleshooting (`File not found on Discord`):**

1. Ensure the channel pointed to by `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL` is also accessible by the Bot (channel mismatch can cause upload success but direct link failure).
2. Grant the Bot `Administrator` permission directly to avoid read failures from missing channel permissions.
3. You must redeploy Cloudflare Pages after changing environment variables (saving variables alone does not apply immediately).
4. Open `/api/status` and check whether Discord status is `bot`, `webhook`, or `bot+webhook`.

**Limits:**
- Non-Boosted server: 25MB/file
- Level 2 Boost: 50MB/file
- Level 3 Boost: 100MB/file

### HuggingFace Storage (Optional)

Use HuggingFace Datasets API to store files. Files are saved to a Dataset repository as git commits.

**Environment variables:**

| Variable | Description | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `HF_TOKEN` | HuggingFace token with write access | `hf_xxxxxxxxxxxx` |
| `HF_REPO` | Dataset repository ID | `username/my-filebed` |

**Deployment steps:**

1. Register a [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co) account
2. Create a new Dataset repository (Settings -> New Dataset)
3. Go to [Settings -> Access Tokens](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens) and create a token (requires Write permission)
4. Add `HF_TOKEN` and `HF_REPO` environment variables in Cloudflare Pages
5. Redeploy

**Limits:**
- Regular upload (base64): about 35MB/file
- LFS upload: up to 50GB/file
- Total free-tier repository size: about 50GB

---

## Guest Upload Feature

Allows non-logged-in users to upload files. Site owners can configure whether it is enabled and apply restriction rules.

| Variable | Description | Default |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `GUEST_UPLOAD` | Enable guest upload | `false` |
| `GUEST_MAX_FILE_SIZE` | Max guest single-file size (bytes) | `5242880` (5MB) |
| `GUEST_DAILY_LIMIT` | Guest daily upload limit (by IP) | `10` |

**How to enable:**

1. Set `GUEST_UPLOAD` = `true` in environment variables
2. Adjust `GUEST_MAX_FILE_SIZE` and `GUEST_DAILY_LIMIT` as needed
3. Ensure `BASIC_USER` and `BASIC_PASS` are configured (otherwise guest/admin cannot be distinguished)
4. Redeploy

**Feature behavior:**
- Guests can upload directly from the homepage without login
- Guest uploads are limited by single-file size and daily count
- Guests cannot use chunked uploads or advanced storage options (S3/Discord/HuggingFace)
- Guests cannot access the admin panel or gallery page
- Limits are based on guest IP address and reset daily

## Usage Limits

**Cloudflare free quota:**

- 100,000 requests/day
- KV: 1,000 writes/day, 100,000 reads/day, 1,000 list operations/day
- Upgrade to a paid plan if exceeded (starting from $5/month)
- For Telegram-heavy scenarios, signed direct links or low-KV-write mode are recommended to reduce quota pressure
- In Docker self-host mode, these Cloudflare quotas do not apply to the Node runtime itself (limits depend on your server/storage backend)

**File size limits by storage backend:**

| Storage backend | Max single-file size |
| :--- | :--- |
| Telegram (web direct upload) | Small-file direct upload 20MB; current chunked flow limit 100MB |
| Telegram (self-hosted Bot API + Telegram client + Webhook) | Depends on Bot API and deployment environment, commonly up to 2GB |
| Cloudflare R2 | 100MB (chunked upload) |
| S3-compatible storage | 100MB (chunked upload) |
| Discord (non-Boosted) | 25MB |
| Discord (Level 2+) | 50-100MB |
| HuggingFace | 35MB (regular) / 50GB (LFS) |

> Note: `/api/upload-from-url` currently still applies a 20MB limit for Telegram uploads.
